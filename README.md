# fpga-spi-flasher-project

This project aims to create HDL which can read and write to external SPI flash memory. The FPGA will take data via UART and 
write this data to the external flash. The main logic will also be able to read back the data on flash and output this to the user logic.
At the moment this project is incomplete and can only echo uart data
